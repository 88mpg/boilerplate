# Dependencies

#### It's a one-time process...

Before getting started, you'll need to make sure you have some required dependencies installed on your computer: [Node.js](//nodejs.org) and [Grunt](//gruntjs.com/). You should also be familiar working with a [command line interface](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) (most likely Terminal).

1.  Install Node by visiting the [Node.js website](//nodejs.org) and downloading their latest install client. So Simple!
2.  After installing Node and NPM, you can install the Grunt client on the command line with the following:

        sudo npm install -g grunt-cli

    # Getting Started

1.  Clone the repo ([link](//github.com/88mpg/boilerplate)) to your localhost root.
                `git clone https://github.com/88mpg/boilerplate.git`
2.  Enter directory and install dependencies.
                `cd boilerplate
                sudo npm install`
3.  Watch files with Grunt.
                `grunt watch'

**NOTE:** To stop watching, press _Ctrl+C_ in your Terminal.
4.  If you'd like to use LiveReload (automatic page reloading) in conjunction with `grunt watch`, install the [appropriate browser extension for your environment](//feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-). Once installed, click the new icon in your navigation bar to activate livereload for the page you're working on. Now, when you save a file while watching your project your page will reload automatically!

# Working With Files

#### Some consider this the fun part.
